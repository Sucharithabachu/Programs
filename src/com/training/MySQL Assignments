-- 19. Create an index on the Name column of Students.
CREATE INDEX idx_students_name ON Students(Name);

-- 20. Find top 3 youngest students.
SELECT *
FROM Students
ORDER BY Age ASC

SELECT d.DepartmentName, COUNT(c.CourseID) AS CourseCount
FROM Departments d
LEFT JOIN Courses c ON d.DepartmentID = c.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName;
